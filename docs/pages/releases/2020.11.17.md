Minor release.

- [**NEW** Installation confirmation](#install-confirmation) Ragdoll now lets you know whether the install went successful or not. This appears on first launch, and can be revisited via the Ragdoll menu. This is also where updates will be found, along with future new-user material like links to docs and tutorials.
- **FIXED** The `Ragdoll | Character` menu item has been fixed and is operating at 100%
