Minor maintenance release.

- [**FIXED** userSetup.py](#userSetup) More robust integration with some pipelines
- [**FIXED** Two-chain Dynamic Control](#two-chain-dynamic-control) More able to deal with edge-cases

### userSetup

The startup code for Ragdoll since 2021.01.14 didn't play well with other `userSetup.py` files, like the ones you might have in a major production pipeline.

If you were having any issues with the `os` module, then this is the fix for you.

### Two-chain Dynamic Control

The previous release made it possible for the last selected Dynamic Control to inherit its size and orientation from the previously selected control.

This only worked if you have 3 controls selected. This release makes it work on just 2 controls!
