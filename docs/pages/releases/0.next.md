<br>

### Environment

Ragdoll now supports static environments; meaning environments that cannot move or deform, but allow for normal polygonal geometry without the need for a simplified "convex hull".

As you might expect, this works well for environments like terrain and other complex geometry that is otherwise hard to turn into a rounded mesh.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/155138876-9544e306-c93f-4891-ad3d-070ed8a78826.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Performance

It's fast.

Normal shapes are limited in how complex they can get, and as such you never really run into a situation where the shape noticeably affects performance.

Triangle meshes are different; they can be of *any* complexity. Up to millions of polygons and beyond. So it falls upon you to decide where to make the performance/quality tradeoff!

| Vertex Count | Cooking Time | Run-time performance
|:-------------|:-------------|:---------------------
| 400          | 0.39 ms      | 685 fps
| 8'000        | 3.51 ms      | 599 fps
| 16'000       | 14.3 ms      | 594 fps
| 64'000       | 61.5 ms      | 327 fps
| 256'000      | 287.7 ms     | 40 fps
| 1'000'000    | 1490 ms      | 2 fps

!!! question "What is cooking time?"
    The time it takes for Ragdoll to convert your polygonal geometry into the internal representation needed for collision detection. It involves splitting up the mesh into areas or "zones" for faster lookup.

    This only happens when the mesh actively changes and when first opening the Maya scene, and won't affect playback speed.

<br>

### Automatic Mesh Islands

In the previous release, you were given the ability to slice a single mesh up into pieces, and have all pieces glued together as one complex shape. This grants you a great deal of control over the final collision shape

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/155695778-1f05ecd3-9168-4419-92e6-6a8f2ef2498d.mp4 controls

??? hint "Multi-cut settings"
    Tick the `Extract Faces` box, and zero out those values to get Maya to perform an actual split in the geometry as you cut. Otherwise, it will only insert new edge-loops and not actually create two separate meshes.

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/155693555-27659b1f-16f5-45d7-b1c4-9d196b457cb8.png)

It did however mean that you had to take the time to manually slice up the mesh, which may not always be feasible. This release introduces an *automatic* method of slicing up a given mesh, into a close approximation of the original mesh.

#### Attributes

There are a number of parameters to tune when generating your convex hulls, here's what they mean.

| Attribute               | Description
|:------------------------|:------------
| `Resolution`            | The number of "voxels" to generate from a given volume; the greater the number the more accurate the resulting representation. At the expense of time. Values between 100-1000 are normally sufficient.
| `Concavity`             | The maximum allowed different in angle across the surface of the resulting meshes. It might be thought of as "roundness".
| `Symmetry Bias`         | Slices are made either horizontally and vertically, or radially. This value controls how much to favour the former.
| `Revolute Bias`         | And this value controls how much to favour the latter
| `Min Volume`            | Ignore computed volumes that are smaller than this. It can help reduce the number of very tiny meshes.
| `Max Convex Hulls`      | How many separate meshes to make. This will depend on the complexity of your mesh, but generally the lower the better.
| `Plane Downsampling`    | Performance related, lower values take longer
| `Hull Downsampling`     | Also perforamnce related, lower values take longer
| `Fill Mode`             | Various ways to deal with geometry that isn't a closed volume. A sphere for example is a closed volume, whereas a plane is not.
| `Approximate Hull`      | Performance related, faster when ticked.
| `Project Hull Vertices` | See what the generated meshes look like before they are "shrink-wrapped" back onto your model. These give you a good sense of how large the voxel resolution is.

!!! info "Complexity"
    Over time, as we learn more about which parameters work best in the most general case, I'd like to reduce the number of attributes here. Ideally we would only have a `Quality` attribute with `Low`, `Medium` and `High` settings.

#### Performance

The process of automatically slicing your geometry is not real-time, it can take up to a few seconds or more. Here's the timings for the meshes in the above animation.

| Object                   | Pieces | Time
|:-------------------------|:-------|:-----------
| `rMarker_Barrels`        | 30  | *1.9 s*
| `rMarker_Ceratopsia`     | 16  | *0.7 s*
| `rMarker_FingerPlates`   | 64  | *6.1 s*
| `rMarker_LeaflessTree`   | 183 | *6.3 s*
| `rMarker_bull`           | 16  | *0.8 s*
| `rMarker_fish`           | 16  | *0.7 s*
| `rMarker_hand_basemesh`  | 16  | *0.3 s*
| `rMarker_horse`          | 16  | *0.9 s*
| `rMarker_humanBody`      | 32  | *2.9 s*
| `rMarker_jetFighter`     | 16  | *0.5 s*
| `rMarker_polySurface9`   | 16  | *1.6 s*
| `rMarker_shirt`          | 16  | *0.9 s*

!!! info "Faster performance is on the map"
    This method is new to us, and we expect to find faster - ideally real-time - alternatives to this in the future.

### Quality of Life

A few more things to make your day that much more bright.

<br>

#### Manipulator Selection

You can now use the Manipulator to select both the Marker and Maya node, such that attributes can be edited in the Channel Box.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/155746045-94565d92-20bc-478c-851d-44f55bb23f77.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Manipulator Fit-to-view

Using the manipulator via the Ragdoll menu enabled you to also benefit from the `F` key, to fit your selection to the current camera.

But if a Marker or Group was selected and editable in the Channel Box, that no longer worked. Because under the hood, what you were really fitting in view was the solver shape node.

This has now been fixed such that you can fit any selected Marker, regardless of whether the solver shape node is selected or not!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/155746051-70d2a52b-51d2-40da-a3e5-b167231d5202.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Select During Playback

The Manipulator can now be used to select Markers during playback.

!!! info "Caveat"
    Selection is based on the current simulated state and doesn't understand rewind. To fix this, step at least 1 frame forward whenever you attempt to select, to ensure the selection and simulation is staying in sync.

    This will be addressed in a future release.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/155746057-1863b9f0-437b-4044-9912-76dab2cee5ee.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Reset Shape

Whenever you assign a Marker, a default shape is computed based on your selection and available geometry or NURBS curves.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/155744034-8544c0ba-f733-4f97-b098-eab95e5bcef7.png)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/155743902-69f1269e-72f0-4884-b9f2-50740df0a410.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Refit Assignment

Likewise, when you branched off into a tree-like structure for your markers, you could easily end up with something like this.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/155589792-71c0756b-a5a5-4721-b848-6456b5c2d274.mp4 controls

This has now been addressed, whereby the marker which forms a fork now being reset automatically.

<br>

#### Licence Conservation

!!! note "Applies to"
    This feature only applies to Floating Licence customers.

In the previous release, a licence was leased on plug-in load.

The problem was that, sometimes, an artist merely opens a scene with Ragdoll in it. Maya will determine that this file requires the Ragdoll plug-in to be loaded, and loads it. Upon load, Ragdoll would go ahead and check out a licence. But this artist doesn't necessarily want to interact with Ragdoll, it could have been a texture artist opening up an animator's scene, or someone rendering it.

This release introduces "licence conservation" which only tries to lease a licence upon a simulation taking place. That means a lease is not made on plug-in load, nor on scene open. If a solver is hidden from view, nor does it take place on playback start.

Only once simulation visibly begins is a lease requested, helping you save those precious seats for the artists that need it most.

Markers are still rendered in the viewport on the start frame for everyone, without a lease. The Solver is automatically hidden upon failure to lease a licence, pausing any further requests until it is made visible again.

<br>

#### Minor Releases

Inbetween this release and the previous release there were a few minor releases made.

- Fix crash on fit-to-view
- Fix crash on replaced mesh with 0 vertices
- Hide prototype world and local attributes on the `rdGroup` node
